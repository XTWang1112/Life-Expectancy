# Life-Expectancy
A practice of Pandas and Seaborn

## Request 1
I am working on a project to analyse the World’s demographic trends.
I am required to produce a scatterplot illustrating Birth Rate and Internet Usage statistics by Country.
The scatterplot needs to also be categorised by Countries’ Income Groups. 

## Request 2
I am received an urgent update from your manager. 
I am required to produce a second scatterplot also illustrating Birth Rate and Internet Usage statistics by Country.
However, this time the scatterplot needs to be categorised by Countries’ Regions.
Additional data has been supplied in the form of lists.

## Challenge
I am required to produce a scatterplot depicting Life Expectancy (y-axis) and Fertility Rate (x-axis) statistics by Country. 
The scatterplot need to be categorised by Countries Regions.
I have been supplied with data for 2 years: 1960 and 2013 and you are requires to produce a visualisation for each of these years.
Some data has been provided in a CSV file, some in Python lists. 
All data manipulations have to be performed in Python (not in Excel) because this project can be audited at the later stage.
I also have been requested to provide insights into how the two periods compare.
