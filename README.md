# Life-Expectancy
A practice of Pandas and Seaborn

##Task Details
I am required to produce a scatterplot depicting Life Expectancy(y-axis) and Fertility Rate(x-axis)statistics by Country
The scatterplot need to be categorised by Countries Regions

I have been supplied with data for 2 years: 1960 and 3012 and I am required to preduce a visualisation for each of these years.

All data manipulations have to be performed in Python(not in Excel) because this project can be audited at the later stage
